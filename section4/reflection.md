## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?
im not doing that. sorry, this has to be where i put my foot down because i will get so distracted by
the pomodoro technique. i have rampant adhd and anything added to the work will mess with me irreperably.
i have tried it in the past and it disrupts my workflow intensly. nope.
i feel like someone is gonna be upset with this, so let me just elaborate. i have a distinct hatred for unneeded interruptions, they cause me an intense amount of anxiety. i am pretty good at taking breaks when i need to, i have set amounts of time i like to look for, and i regularly check the clock AFTER i finish something so im not interrupting myself, because i will lose all semblence of what i am doing if i have alarms go off. and they panic me.

1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?
i can set intentions just fine. intentions are easy for me, for me to do anything i automatically set my
intention, or else i dont do anything. this whole "pomodoro technique" and forcing myself to consciously
affix extra intentions to what i already know to do muddles the water. i have techniques i have forced myself
to use to keep even keel, and those work great. i have a system of notes that is simple, a method of logging information i feel might be forgotten, and ways to make sure i am taking my breaks of my own implementation.

1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?
objects store what is basically a variable (key data pair) in a list, whereas arrays just store data sets. you can
attribute data to the keys stored in an object.
1. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class - array
  * List of states and their capitals - object
  * List of things to pack for vacation - Array
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow - array
  * List of student names and their cohort - object
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake - object
  * All my favorite restaurants -array

1. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?
i mean, probably back to another example i used, the gundam models themselves probably are all items.
they would have different keys so that you could tag them, like "gundamSeries: Gundam wing" or
"gundamGrade: 'Master Grade'".

1. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?
classes still weird me out. theres a lot of syntax stuff i am confused about, like what "this." is calling to.
when you establish a property.
