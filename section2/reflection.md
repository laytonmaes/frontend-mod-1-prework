## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

asking questions is always a good thing. it can give clarification on any aspects that might not completely make sense about something, regardless of if you feel like the basic concept makes sense. its always good to learn from those who have already been and already done what you are doing.
i ask them too soon if anything, and i ask questions that more often than not go unanswered due to instructors not really knowing the answer, as it hasnt come up. but i think i ask many relevent questions when info needs to be added.

1. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

honestly felt fine. i come from an art background, which means i regularly look up functions,
learn from others, and am very comfortable learning on my own.

1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.
a conditional statement is a statement that basically says "if or when x = one thing, do this"
it evaluates the condition of a variable, and declares action appropriately.

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.
you add multiple conditions by establishing initial 'if' statement, then saying either 'else' or 'else if'
a program reads else if as "if its not if function 1, check if its if function 2. if so, do this."
else reads as "if it aint any of the above, do this"

1. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?
if you wanna check that both conditions are met, use and (&&), if its just one of two conditions,
use or (||)

1. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?
I guess can you run if statements in functions, and since the answer is yes, like to what end.
to be honest i just wanna see sort of how this all comes together.
