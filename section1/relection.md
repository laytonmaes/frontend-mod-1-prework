## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?
it honestly didn't. i do all the things that it talked about and it wasn't anything new really.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.
boolean functions are yes no, true false functions. they are used to compare things.
strings are sentences or anything you want to print out with letters. they print actual people words
numbers are numbers. i really dont feel like that needs more explanation.

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?
console.log("Hello World!")

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?
// these allow you to explain whats happening or set up notes for your function.

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?
variables are like inventory slots. you put something in your slot, and then you can use it in game.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?
mechawarehouse, a gundam store. probably
itemCost
itemName
seriesOfOrigin

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.
concatention is where you combine variables in the log. it can be used to build strings with variables and whatnot.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatention?
same place.
console.log(itemName + "is from "+ seriesOfOrigin)

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)
if i concatenate with numbers, do i have to add a string between them to keep them from adding?
