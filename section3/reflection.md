## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
I had never hear of S.M.A.R.T. goals, so thats new.
i guess also zone of proximal developement is interesting. the idea of improving in ways that benefit your area of expertise is sometimes hard.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
time bound goals are rough for me, so thats probably the largest way im not a "growth mindset oriented person"
otherwise, i am litterally constantly learning and looking for efficient methods of learning and improving. i feel like thats as "growth mindset" as you can get.
1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.
In my mechawarehouse example, i guess an easy array would be establishing a cart. you can add and subtract to the array, and at the end of it all, just pull up all of the data on each item in the cart.

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.
an array method is something you can do to alter or utilize an array.
1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?
a loop allows us to do things that are going to need to do the same basic thing a bunch of times in a row,
without having to code it a bunch of times in a row.
we would use it in conjunction with an array if we need to do a loop with an array, ie running
through all the parts of an array to add them to a different array or object or something.
we would use them without if we dont need to do something to an array. gonna be real, dont understand
what this question is asking.
1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?
a loop is something you set up to do the same thing over and over again until you are out of things to do.
1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
im sort of theory crafting how to utilize arrays in some weird ways, so i wanna play with that. no specific
questions other than some ideas, like adding variables to arrays, whether you can split a string into pieces,
construct a loop to idk, reverse it then put it back together. stuff like that.
